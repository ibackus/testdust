This test attempts to reproduce the results of the Price & Laibe 2015 
"Dust settling in a protoplanetary disc" test (section 4.4).  This is a 
2-dimensional test.

This is the low resolution test (16 by 56 particles).  All parameters are
the same as in the PL15 test (to the best of my abilities).  

This needs to be run with dust + ND-SPH (currently on the dust/ndsph branch
of the ibackus fork of ChaNGa).  To compile (2D SPH + dust):

    ./configure --enable-dustygas=fraction --enable-ndsph=2

Currently, this produces very noisy results.  Only the M4 cubic kernel has
been tested, not the Wendland kernel.  Higher resolution tests also seem to
be very noisy.
