This folder contains the high-resolution dust settling test of Price & Laibe
2015.  To the best of my abilities, the ICs were generated exactly as in PL15.
Key points about the ICgen process here:
    * 2 dimensions
    * Start with stretched hexagonal grid
    * Use the Wendland C4 kernel throughout
    * Settle the gas using a damping force
    
This high-resolution test starts with 64 x 222 particles.  At the current state,
the settling rate does not appear to agree with PL15 figure 8, but that may
just be due to some small differences tStop due to a typo in their paper.
Outputs are approximately every "orbit", defined by 2*pi*sqrt(R0^3/GM)

This needs to be run with wendland, dust + ND-SPH (currently on the dust/ndsph branch
of the ibackus fork of ChaNGa).  To compile (2D SPH + dust + wendland):

    ./configure --enable-dustygas=fraction --enable-ndsph=2

NOTE: this was generated with alpha = 20 (by mistake!) during the gas settling
phase and is currently set to run with alpha = 1.  alpha = 0.01 may work better.
